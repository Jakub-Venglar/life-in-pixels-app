# life-in-pixels-app
This is my learning project. Result should be "life in pixels" app for mobile phones, where user can easily track his mood or overal impression from his days.
Every day will have its color according to what user set. 
User can also add some text comment or track their habits.
Later there should be possibility for export for nice print.
I also would like to add option to uppload one picture for a day and store everything in cloud for safe backup.
