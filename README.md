# life-in-pixels-app
This is my learning project. Result should be "life in pixels" app for mobile phones, where user can easily track his mood or overal impression from his days.
Every day will have its defined color. User can also add some text comment.
I also would like to add option to uppload one picture for a day and store everything in cloud for safe backup.
